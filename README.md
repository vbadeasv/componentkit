[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/facebook/componentkit.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/facebook/componentkit)

ComponentKit is a view framework for iOS that is heavily inspired by React. It takes a functional, declarative approach to building UI. It was built to power Facebook's News Feed and is now used throughout the Facebook iOS app.

### Quick start

ComponentKit is available to install via [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) or [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage). 

If you are using CocoaPods, add the following to your [Podfile](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/the-podfile.html):

```ruby
pod 'ComponentKit', '~> 0.14'
```

If you are using Carthage, add the following to your [Cartfile](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage/blob/master/Documentation/Artifacts.md#cartfile):

```
github "facebook/ComponentKit" ~> 0.14
```

If you have CocoaPods and want to quickly try WildeGuess, the ComponentKit demo project, then run the following:

```ruby
pod try ComponentKit
```
